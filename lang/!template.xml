This file is a template for the language file of the client part of the Fish Advisor.

Translators may just write the translated version of the English text as content of the XML tag, e.g.
    <entry key="Twig">Zweig</entry>
for the German translation.
It is CRUCIAL to maintain punctuation and spaces at the end of the strings!

Remember to also translate the client-side dictionary file "_template.js",
which can be found in this same directory.

The root tag at the beginning of the file, that is,
    <language code="" name="">
identifies the language of this file.
The specified code should be a valid ISO 639-1 language code, e.g. "en" for English.
The specified name should be the name of the language in its own language. This would be
"Français" for French and "Deutsch" for German.
